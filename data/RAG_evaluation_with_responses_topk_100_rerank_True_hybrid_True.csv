Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of IBRD. IFC is not liable for the obligations of the other WBG institutions. FINANCIAL BUSINESS MODEL IFC helps developing countries achieve sustainable growth by financing private sector investment, mobilizing capital in international financial markets, and providing advisory services to businesses and governments.

In FY21, IFC’s Corporate Risk Committee approved a Risk Appetite (RA) framework for IFC.

On the financial risks faced by IFC, one of the ways in which the risk appetite is expressed is by key financial policies approved by its Board of Directors as detailed below: •Capital Adequacy Policy — IFC is required to maintain a minimum level of total resources (including paidin capital, total loss reserve and retained earnings, net of designations) equal to total potential losses for all onand offbalance sheet exposures', '$3 million and $ 2 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 of equity investments primarily accounted for under the cost recovery method.

The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the process of being completely or partially privatized.

IFC also monitors clients’ environmental and social (E&S) performance in a riskbased manner and measures financial performance and development results. IFC closely assesses its equity portfolio on an ongoing basis including proactively identifying assets ready for divestments where IFC’s development role has been completed. This rebalancing of the equity portfolio is the result of an analysis that takes into account market conditions, opportunities, expected returns, and risks, and is adjusted periodically as required. To improve its governance structure, IFC has appointed Global Equity Heads, who focus on strategic business development, central oversight and management of IFC’s larger and more complex equity positions throughout the investment lifecycle.

LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (ALM) RISK IFC defines liquidity and funding risk as the risk that, over a specific horizon, IFC will be unable to meet the demand for additional funds to meet the demand for uses of funds due to either funding or liquidity issues or both. IFC faces liquidity risk in its core development finance activities because its investments are predominantly illiquid in nature due to the lack of capital flows, the infrequency of transactions, and the lack of price transparency in many emerging markets. To offset this risk, IFC maintains appropriate liquid assets funded from its net worth and market borrowings. IFC manages the risk of mismatches in foreign exchange rates, interest rates,', 'additional subordinated financial support or whose activities are so narrowly defined by contracts that equity investors are considered to lack decision making ability, which IFC does not consolidate because it does not have the power to control the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This executive summary highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this document. For a complete description of IFC’s FY24 performance, as well as the risks and critical accounting estimates affecting IFC, this MD&A should be read in its entirety. IFC is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries. Established in 1956, IFC is owned by 186 member countries, a group that collectively determines its policies. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group (WBG)1 but is a legal entity separate and distinct from IBRD, IDA, MIGA, and ICSID, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of IBRD. IFC is not liable for the obligations of the other institutions. IFC’s mission — as one of the WBG entities — is to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on', 'using an economic capital framework, which is the foundation of financial risk management at IFC. Economic capital acts as a “common currency of risk” across the organization, providing IFC with an objective, quantifiable measure of risk that can be applied consistently across business lines, products, regions, and sectors. IFC holds economic capital for credit, market, and operational risks. The economic capital framework covers IFC’s entire balance sheets — debt, equity, and Treasury assets — and economic capital is used for limitsetting, pricing, and riskadjusted performance measurement. The primary measure of capital adequacy is IFC’s Capital Utilization Ratio (CUR), which is the ratio of Capital Required for the current portfolio to the Capital Available to support future commitments. Throughout FY24, IFC’s CUR was well within the established threshold of < 88 percent. PENSION RISK IFC participates, along with IBRD and MIGA, in pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Staff', ""to build and proactively manage a portfolio that produces strong financial results and development impact. IFC achieves this through a combination of strong presence on the ground and deep sector expertise, that enables IFC to stay close to its clients and markets, monitor trends and anticipate impacts of external factors. Active portfolio management depends on timely and accurate information to drive business decisions. Regional investment teams regularly review the regional industry portfolio with Senior Management and Risk to ensure continued oversight and assess broad trends as well as performance of select projects. Additionally, quarterly reviews of IFC’s portfolio results are presented to the Board, along with an indepth analysis at the end of each fiscal year. IFC's investment and portfolio teams, largely based in field offices, complement global reviews with assetby-asset quarterly assessments for investments.

To manage risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, and credit spread risks, a system of limits has been employed and closely monitored on a daily basis to ensure ongoing compliance throughout the fiscal year. LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (ALM) RISK IFC defines liquidity and funding risk as the risk that, over a specific horizon, IFC will be unable to meet the demand for additional funds to meet the demand for uses of funds due to either funding or liquidity issues or both. IFC faces liquidity risk in its core development finance activities because its investments are predominantly illiquid in nature due to the lack of capital flows, the infrequency of transactions, and the lack of price transparency in many emerging markets. To offset this risk, IFC maintains appropriate liquid assets funded from its net worth and market borrowings. IFC manages the risk of mismatches in foreign exchange rates, interest rates,', 'and limits on the percentage of total bond issuance held by IFC. Consequently, a significant portion of the liquid asset portfolio is invested in highly liquid securities such as highquality sovereign, sovereignguaranteed, and supranational fixed income instruments. IFC expects to continue to be able to realize these assets as needed to meet its cash requirements, even in a liquidity crisis. FUNDING IFC’s funding operations ensure that IFC has the funds required for its lending operations, and that it has sufficient liquidity to safeguard its tripleA rating and fulfill its countercyclical role. IFC can access a variety of funding markets, including the U.S. dollar market, British pound market and the Australian dollar market as well as private placement and retail markets. IFC’s discount note program complements its traditional funding sources by providing swift access to shortterm funded liquidity. IFC’s tripleA rating is critical to the Corporation’s ability to maintain its low cost', 'The following tables present the changes in the carrying value of IFC’s Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities for the years ended June 30, 2024 , June 30, 2023 , and June 30, 2022 .

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the actuarial gains were primarily due to an increase in the discount rates. Investment Strategy The investment policies establish the framework for investment of t he plan assets based on longterm investment objectives and the tradeoffs inherent in seeking adequate investment returns within acceptable risk parameters. A key component of the investment policy is to establish a Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) representing the policy portfolio (i.e., policy mix of assets) around which the SRP and RSBP (the Plans) are invested. The SAA is derived using a mix of quantitative analysis that incorporates expected returns and volatilities by asset class as', 'level of reserve against losses carried a heightened degree of uncertainty and judgment.

There was also an increase in Capital Required, primarily due to the need for additional capital to support the Loan and Equity portfolios. During FY24, IFC updated its capital adequacy framework. Effective from Q3, IFC increased the granularity in economic capital calculations for trade finance, and also brought IFC’s definition of Capital Available more closely into alignment with Basel Framework and S&P rating methodology by deducting the pension surplus of each pension plan. Effective from Q4, IFC excluded the PCRF assets from Capital Available, aligning with its intended use for postretirement contributions.

Emerging markets also increased, with the MSCI EM total return index up by 13 percent, to a level which is still significantly below the highs seen in early 2021. Additionally, the US dollar strengthened 7 percent against a basket of emerging market currencies (JPMorgan EM currency index).

Investment Strategy The investment policies establish the framework for investment of t he plan assets based on longterm investment objectives and the tradeoffs inherent in seeking adequate investment returns within acceptable risk parameters. A key component of the investment policy is to establish a Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) representing the policy portfolio (i.e., policy mix of assets) around which the SRP and RSBP (the Plans) are invested. The SAA is derived using a mix of quantitative analysis that incorporates expected returns and volatilities by asset class as', 'cost $ 35,729 INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION Page 95 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE E – LOANS AND GUARANTEES (continued) The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.June 30, 2023 (US$ in millions)Very Strong Strong Adequate Moderate WeakVery Weak/ Special AttentionVery Weak/ SubstandardExtremely Weak/ DoubtfulImminent Default/ Default Total Geographic Region Africa $ — $ 25 $ 394 $ 1,992 $ 3,303 $ 313 $ 205 $ 137 $ 209 $ 6,578 Asia and Pacific 69 460 3,284 3,250 2,019 192 6 18 78 9,376 Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe — 517 2,515 4,255 1,497 356 98 215 170 9,623 Middle East, Central Asia, Türkiye, Pakistan, and Afghanistan — — 179 1,537 1,315 365 0 28 254 3,678 Other 40 473 111 1,365 — — — — — 1,989 Total geographic region $ 109 $ 1,475 $ 6,483 $ 12,399 $ 8,134 $ 1,226 $ 309 $ 398 $ 711 $ 31,244 Unamortized deferred loan origination fees, net and other (127) Loans at amortized cost $ 31,117 June 30, 2023 (US$', 'Assets from 13% to 15% while marginally reducing the Public Equities allocation from 31% to 29% and Market Neutral Hedge Funds from 10% to 9%.

IFC has also made loans in a number of frontier market currencies such as Vietnamese dong, Tanzanian shilling, Kazakhstan tenge, Bangladeshi taka, Tunisian dinar, Pakistani rupee, and Sri Lankan rupee. As of June 30, 2024, 67 percent of IFC’s disbursed loan portfolio was U.S. dollardenominated (70 percent as of June 30, 2023). After the effect of interest rate swaps and currency swaps, IFC’s loans are principally denominated in variable rate U.S. dollars. The currency composition of the disbursed loan portfolio as of June 30, 2024', 'of borrowingrelated derivatives, and excluding shortterm borrowings from market and other sources, was 5.7 percent at June 30, 2024, an increase from 5.2 percent at June 30, 2023. The increase in charges on borrowings was predominantly due to rising interest rates. The size of the borrowings portfolio (excluding shortterm borrowings), net of borrowingrelated derivatives and before unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments, increased by $3.3 billion during FY24 from $56.7 billion at June 30, 2023, to $60.0 billion at June 30, 2024.

IFC also makes loans to intermediary banks, leasing companies, and other financial institutions for onlending. While IFC’s loans have traditionally been denominated in the major currencies, IFC has made it a priority to structure local currency products. IFC has provided funding in 74 local currencies. Pricing of IFC loans reflects market conditions and country and project risks, and loans are typically variable rate (or swapped into variable rate). Equity Investments — Equity investments provide developmental support and longterm growth capital that private enterprises need. IFC invests directly in companies’ equity, and also through privateequity funds. IFC generally invests between 5 and 20 percent of a company’s equity.

LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (ALM) RISK IFC defines liquidity and funding risk as the risk that, over a specific horizon, IFC will be unable to meet the demand for additional funds to meet the demand for uses of funds due to either funding or liquidity issues or both. IFC faces liquidity risk in its core development finance activities because its investments are predominantly illiquid in nature due to the lack of capital flows, the infrequency of transactions, and the lack of price transparency in many emerging markets. To offset this risk, IFC maintains appropriate liquid assets funded from its net worth and market borrowings. IFC manages the risk of mismatches in foreign exchange rates, interest rates,', 'and limits on the percentage of total bond issuance held by IFC. Consequently, a significant portion of the liquid asset portfolio is invested in highly liquid securities such as highquality sovereign, sovereignguaranteed, and supranational fixed income instruments. IFC expects to continue to be able to realize these assets as needed to meet its cash requirements, even in a liquidity crisis.

In accordance with ASC 326, IFC 's credit loss methodology reflects an estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of a financial asset, considering forwardlooking information. IFC considers the relevant inputs and assumptions required to perform the estimate. These include, but are not limited to, historical and current loan portfolio data, data relevant to current economic conditions, and data relevant to reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. Inputs and assumptions are quantitative or qualitative in nature. In particular, the forecast of key economic variables relevant to the loan portfolio"", 'and credit risk rating, with certain assumptions segmented by industry. The facility risk rating applies to an individual investment product and provides information on the amount of loss that IFC is likely to incur on that product if the obligor defaults. IFC’s forecast of expected credit losses is based on the probability of a loan defaulting associated with each credit risk rating, the expected loss percentage given a default associated with each facility risk rating, and the expected balance at the estimated date of default. The estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers a prepayment assumption and, for loans with available credit, a disbursement assumption that estimates expected utilization rates. The reserve against losses on loans are established through a review process undertaken on a quarterly basis and has two main components: (a) a portfolio reserve for expected losses determined from the historical loss rates, adjusted for qualitative factors, and', 'SECTION IV.

IFC faces liquidity risk in its core development finance activities because its investments are predominantly illiquid in nature due to the lack of capital flows, the infrequency of transactions, and the lack of price transparency in many emerging markets.

LCRs are aligned with Basel liquidity standards for regulated banks, include time horizons between 30 days and 3 years, and consider both normal and stressed cash flow requirements.

IFC can access a variety of funding markets, including the U.S. dollar market, British pound market and the Australian dollar market as well as private placement and retail markets.

Repurchase, resale and securities lending agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Borrowings – To diversify its access to funding, and reduce its borrowing costs, IFC borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of borrowing structures, including foreign exchange ratelinked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. In managing the currency exposure inherent in borrowing in a variety of currencies, generally, IFC either simultaneously converts such borrowings into variable rate U.S. dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions or utilizes']"

Economic capital acts as a “common currency of risk” across the organization, providing IFC with an objective, quantifiable measure of risk that can be applied consistently across business lines, products, regions, and sectors.

The economic capital framework covers IFC’s entire balance sheets — debt, equity, and Treasury assets — and economic capital is used for limitsetting, pricing, and riskadjusted performance measurement.

During FY24, IFC recorded a gain of $130 million ($127 million of unrecognized net actuarial gains and a $3 million reduction of prior service cost).

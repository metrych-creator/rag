OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Consistent with the Basel Framework, IFC defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, and holds economic capital against such risks. Given IFC\u2019s business model, both financial and nonfinancial potential impacts are considered in assessment of risks. IFC\u2019s Operational Risk Management (ORM) program conforms to a Directive approved by the Corporate Risk Committee, which defines the management of, and roles and responsibilities for, operational risk management in the Corporation.

Economic capital acts as a \u201ccommon currency of risk\u201d across the organization, providing IFC with an objective, quantifiable measure of risk that can be applied consistently across business lines, products, regions, and sectors. IFC holds economic capital for credit, market, and operational risks. The economic capital framework covers IFC\u2019s entire balance sheets \u2014 debt, equity, and Treasury assets \u2014 and economic capital is used for limitsetting, pricing, and riskadjusted performance measurement. The primary measure of capital adequacy is IFC\u2019s Capital Utilization Ratio (CUR), which is the ratio of Capital Required for the current portfolio to the Capital Available to support future commitments. Throughout FY24, IFC\u2019s CUR was well within the established threshold of < 88 percent. PENSION RISK IFC participates, along with IBRD and MIGA, in pension and postretirement benefit plans.

In FY21, IFC\u2019s Corporate Risk Committee approved a Risk Appetite (RA) framework for IFC. The purpose of the RA framework is to: (i) compare and contrast IFC\u2019s risk appetite against its risk exposure; (ii) communicate the target level of risks to stakeholders; (iii) provide context for the risk policies and frameworks; (iv) make informed decisions; and (v) report on risks to the Board and management. On the financial risks faced by IFC, one of the ways in which the risk appetite is expressed is by key financial policies approved by its Board of Directors as detailed below: \u2022Capital Adequacy Policy \u2014 IFC is required to maintain a minimum level of total resources (including paidin capital, total loss reserve and retained earnings, net of designations) equal to total potential losses for all onand offbalance sheet exposures", "IFC invests in certain debt securities with conversion features; if the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in net income, these features are accounted for in accordance with ASC 815 to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative.INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION Page 75 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A \u2013 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) The notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements. 74 IFC 2024 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS", "IFC\u2019s principal investment products are loans, equity investments, debt securities and guarantees. IFC also plays an active and direct role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders through a variety of means (Core Mobilization). Unlike most other development institutions, IFC does not accept host government guarantees of repayment. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance of debt obligations in the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with IBRD. Equity investments are funded from capital (net worth). Proceeds of borrowings from market sources or net worth not immediately disbursed for investments are managed internally by IFC in its liquid asset portfolio. IFC\u2019s capital base and its assets and liabilities, other than its equity investments, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars ($ or US$) or swapped into U.S. dollars. Overall, IFC seeks to minimize foreign exchange and", "earnings, paidin capital, and other comprehensive income. There was also an increase in Capital Required, primarily due to the need for additional capital to support the Loan and Equity portfolios. During FY24, IFC updated its capital adequacy framework. Effective from Q3, IFC increased the granularity in economic capital calculations for trade finance, and also brought IFC\u2019s definition of Capital Available more closely into alignment with Basel Framework and S&P rating methodology by deducting the pension surplus of each pension plan. Effective from Q4, IFC excluded the PCRF assets from Capital Available, aligning with its intended use for postretirement contributions.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the actuarial gains were primarily due to an increase in the discount rates. Investment Strategy The investment policies establish the framework for investment of t he plan assets based on longterm investment objectives and the tradeoffs inherent in seeking adequate investment returns within acceptable risk parameters. A key component of the investment policy is to establish a Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) representing the policy portfolio (i.e., policy mix of assets) around which the SRP and RSBP (the Plans) are invested.

Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results differ from expected results in determining the funded status of the pension plans. Since the pension plans are long term, changes in asset returns and discount rates cause volatility in comprehensive income. Given its longterm planning horizon for pension plans, Management is focused mainly on ensuring that contributions to pension plans appropriately reflect longterm assumptions about asset returns and discount rates. During FY24, IFC recorded a gain of $130 million ($127 million of unrecognized net actuarial gains and a $3 million reduction of prior service cost). The decrease in the underfunded status of the portion of the pension plans, net of PEBP assets, was primarily due to the increase in the value of the Plan Assets due to higherthan-expected assets returns.

Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of IBRD. IFC is not liable for the obligations of the other WBG institutions. FINANCIAL BUSINESS MODEL IFC helps developing countries achieve sustainable growth by financing private sector investment, mobilizing capital in international financial markets, and providing advisory services to businesses and governments.
